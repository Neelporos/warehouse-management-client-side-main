                in a way that you can efficiently query or update it later, then
                you would typically use some form of database. There are dozens
                of popular databases. MongoDB is one such database. MariaDB,

                JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share
                security information between two parties â€” a client and a
                server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set
                of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to
                ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is
                issued.
              </td>
              <td>
                JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of
                claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two
                parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand.
                For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long
                it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been
                granted.
